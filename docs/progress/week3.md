# Week 3 (4/14-4/20)

## Meeting Record

## Progress

- Build android studio enviroment in docker.
- Implement navigator class and compare the score of some possible route
- Deprecated route algorithm for navigation, since the left game time brings highier score than staying in oasis, therefore it is better to finish the game as fast as possible.
- Prepare the image dataset and train the first yolo model.
- Implement basic vision handler, not yet test or integral with navigator.
