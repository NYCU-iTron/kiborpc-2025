## Meeting Record

- Report progress.
- Future work split.
- Handle accidents.

## Progress

- Implement ARTagDetector to get tag location in world frame.
- Implement ItemDetector to use yolo model to detect item from image.
- Train yolo model with the dataset that combine unit item and environment.
- Integrate classes in maintrol, performing all in one test.
- Simulation score achieves 278 pt.

## Next

- Improve the variety of dataset to improve yolo model.
- Adjust the target pose in each area to reduce travel time and improve the quality of image.
- Complete the system integration, entering the fine-tuning phase.
